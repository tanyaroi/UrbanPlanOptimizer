ToDo:
- Refactor (break into functions, remove hardcoded, etc.) processor.py and rh_trial.py
- Add Chelkot to code, filter by building type - needed for connecting to new buildings

raw inputs:
- survey.dwg (buildings, attributes)
- chelkot.dxf (plots)

manual inputs:
- compose composite.dwg from 
    - a piece of survey.dwg
    - a corresponding piece of chelkot.dxf
    - match by coordinates and outline
- create composite.csv by exporting from composite.dwg
- create composite.3dm by importing from composite.dwg

auto inputs (processor.py):
- pre-process (clean bad values & remove redundant columns and lines) composite.csv into proc_composite.csv
- split proc_composite.csv to proc_polyline.csv & proc_attributes.csv

rh_trial:
- set scriptcontext.doc to Rhino.ActiveDoc
- remove all blocks
- set current layer
- remove redundant layers
- Add attributes to buildings:
    for each row in proc_attributes.csv
    - for each object in Rhino's buildings layers
        - check if object is a curve
        - if so, check if curve's area bigger than MIN_BUILDING_AREA
        - if so, check if (x,y,z) attributes is inside object
        - if so, add relevent attributes to object's user text (key-value list, a standard dictionary)

- Extrude all buildings according to NUM_FLOORS attribute multiplied by FLOOR_HEIGHT constant
